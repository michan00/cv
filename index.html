    <p>I am a front desk receptionist at D'prima hotel. Right now i pursue my intrest in Web Development and just
        learing it from Udemy video angela yu and colt as well.
        I had some understanding about HTML and CSS and probably soon will learn JavaScript as well and for the
        intention why im learning Web Development its because i was searching a job that i could do remotely and after
        asking some friend as well
        and finding out how to code, i find its really fun to learn and code, to figue out how certain things work and
        make it more beautiful its was like finding some little piece that i was missing. And i will learn more about
        programing languange,
        as a matter in fact right now i already buy course for java and phython programing languange and hopefully i can
        master it soon or at least be good at it. </p>
